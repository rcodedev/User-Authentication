# User-Authentication
This project implements a basic User Authentication System with Sign Up and Login functionality.

## Description

The application allows users to register by creating a username and password using the Sign Up page. During registration, the system validates user input and ensures that the entered credentials meet the required conditions.

On the Login page, users must enter the same username and password that were used during sign up.

If the credentials match, the user is successfully authenticated and redirected to the Home Page.

If the credentials do not match, an error message is displayed indicating invalid login details.

This project demonstrates the core concepts of authentication, input validation, and conditional navigation.
